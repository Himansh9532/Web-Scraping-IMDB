# **IMDB Movie Rating Prediction**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced through web scraping from IMDB, and the model is built to provide accurate predictions based on various features of a movie. The project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to predict ratings by entering specific movie details.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Collection:**  
  Scraped movie data from IMDB using web scraping tools and libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values efficiently to improve data quality.  
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key insights and trends.  
- **Model Building:**  
  - Implemented a **Random Forest Model** for predicting movie ratings.  
  - Achieved a model accuracy of **90%** through feature engineering and optimization.  
- **Model Deployment:**  
  - Deployed the model using **Streamlit**, enabling users to interact with the model via a user-friendly interface.  

## **How It Works**  
1. Input movie details (e.g., genre, release year, cast).  
2. The model processes the input and predicts the expected rating for the movie.  
3. Results are displayed in real-time on the Streamlit dashboard.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, Selenium  
- **Model:** Random Forest  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit  

## **Installation**  
To run the project locally:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Himansh9532/Web-Scrapping  
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the Streamlit application:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

## **Results**  
- Improved model performance by **12%** through efficient handling of missing values.  
- Achieved a **90%** accuracy rate for movie rating predictions.  

## **Future Scope**  
- Include additional features like user reviews and box office collections for better prediction accuracy.  
- Integrate more advanced machine learning algorithms.
